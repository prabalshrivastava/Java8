Java 8 introduced default methods in interfaces, which allow you to add new methods to interfaces without breaking the existing implementations. This feature was introduced to support backward compatibility in existing codebases while enabling the evolution of interfaces.

With the introduction of default methods in interfaces, the line between abstract classes and interfaces has become somewhat blurred, and in some cases, interfaces can now provide behavior similar to abstract classes. However, there are still some differences between interfaces with default methods and abstract classes. Here are some considerations:

1. **Multiple Inheritance:**
    - Interfaces with default methods support multiple inheritance, allowing a class to implement multiple interfaces. In contrast, Java does not support multiple inheritance for classes.

2. **Fields:**
    - Interfaces can't have instance fields, while abstract classes can. If you need to store state in your class, you might prefer an abstract class.

3. **Constructors:**
    - Abstract classes can have constructors, whereas interfaces, including those with default methods, cannot.

4. **Default Method Overriding:**
    - When a class implements multiple interfaces with default methods that have the same signature, you may encounter the diamond problem (similar to multiple inheritance with abstract classes). You'll need to provide an explicit implementation in the implementing class to resolve any conflicts.

5. **Design Considerations:**
    - Abstract classes are useful when you want to provide a common base class with shared state or behavior among its subclasses. They can enforce a certain structure for their subclasses, including the use of abstract methods that must be implemented.

In summary, whether to use an abstract class or an interface with default methods depends on your specific design needs. If you need to provide a common base class, shared state, or enforce a certain structure, an abstract class may be appropriate. If you want to achieve multiple inheritance, provide a mix-in of behavior, or evolve existing interfaces without breaking implementations, interfaces with default methods are a good choice. Often, a combination of both can be used to achieve the desired design.
